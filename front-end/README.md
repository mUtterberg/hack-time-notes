# Front-End Notes

## Margin vs Padding (finally)

I finally figured out a way to keep margin vs padding straight!

- Padding, like a padded room, is inside the border.
- Margin, like a moat, is outside the border.

## Tips for Organizing CSS

- Create logical sections:

  - General styles (body, h1, h2, h3, h4, ul, ol, blockquote, etc)
  - Utilities (.nobullets, .other-common-customizations)
  - Sitewide (.main-nav, .logo, .etc)
  - Store pages (.product-listing, .product-box, etc)

- Avoid overly-specific selectors.

- Break up large stylesheets (duh)
