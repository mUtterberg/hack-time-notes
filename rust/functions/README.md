# Functions

## Statements and Expressions

> In [other] languages, you can write `x = y = 6` and have both x and y have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.
> ...
> Expressions do not include ending semicolons.
> If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
